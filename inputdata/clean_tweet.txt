"I will be leaving the great Walter Reed Medical Center today at 6:30 P.M. Feeling really good! Don‚Äôt be afraid of Covid. Don‚Äôt let it dominate your life. We have developed, under the Trump Administration, some really great drugs &amp; knowledge. I feel better than I did 20 years ago!"

"Because of the China Virus, my Campaign, which has raised a lot of money, was forced to spend in order to counter the Fake News reporting about the way we handled it (China Ban, etc.). We did, and are doing, a GREAT job, and have a lot of money left over, much more than 2016...."

"Sleepy Joe Biden had a particularly bad day today. He couldn‚Äôt remember the name of Mitt Romney, said again he was running for the U.S. Senate, and forgot what State he was in. If I did any of this, it would be disqualifying. With him, he‚Äôs just Sleepy Joe!"

"I was thrilled to be back in OHIO tonight with thousands of loyal, hardworking American Patriots! 43 days from now, we are going to win Ohio, and we are going to win 4 more years in the White House! Secure your vote, here:  
"....We will win the Election against Corrupt Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, and Schumer. We will save the Supreme Court, your 2nd Amendment, permanent damage from the ridiculous Green New Deal, and you from massive Tax Hikes. Also, our Heritage, History and LAW &amp; ORDER!"
"Do not believe the Fake News Media. Oklahoma speech had the highest Saturday television ratings in @FoxNews history. @seanhannity dominated T.V. with my interview on Thursday night, more than @CNN &amp; MSDNC COMBINED. These are the real polls, the Silent Majority, not FAKE POLLS!"
"I will be delivering brief remarks from the Rose Garden at 6:30 P.M. Eastern to update on the Federal Response."
"Congratulations to Jeff @VanDrewForNJ on a Great Primary run, and big VICTORY against a very tough opponent! #MAGA2020

"THANK YOU @RSBNetwork! 
"...Meanwhile, I gave America energy independence in fact, so much energy we could never use it all. The Bernie/Biden/AOC Green New Deal plan would take California‚Äôs failed policies to every American!"
"Wow. Won‚Äôt let Poll Watchers &amp; Security into Philadelpiha Voting Places. There is only one reason why. Corruption!!! Must have a fair Election."
"My fellow Americans - My first and highest duty as President is to defend our great Country and the American People. I swore an oath to uphold the laws of our Nation -- and that is exactly what I will do‚Ä¶ 
"Just returned to the @WhiteHouse after a GREAT evening in OHIO! 
"I‚Äôve been getting really good polls, some over 50%, except for one Fake Poll done by @ABC NEWS, which gives NO INFORMATION about the sample, R or D, or anything else. They did this last Election, with one week to go, down 12 points, and I won. They are disgusting Fake News!"
"YES! 
"In California, Democrats have intentionally implemented rolling blackouts ‚Äî forcing Americans in the dark. Democrats are unable to keep up with energy demand..."
"Their minds are gone!!! 
"Wow. Won‚Äôt let Poll Watchers &amp; Security into Philadelphia Voting Places. There is only one reason why. Corruption!!! Must have a fair Election."
"The Radical Left Mayors &amp;  Governors of Cities where this crazy violence is taking place have lost control of their ‚ÄúMovement‚Äù. It wasn‚Äôt supposed to be like this, but the Anarchists &amp; Agitators got carried away and don‚Äôt listen anymore - even forced Slow Joe out of basement!"
"If I didn‚Äôt INSIST on having the National Guard activate and go into Kenosha, Wisconsin, there would be no Kenosha right now. Also, there would have been great death and injury. I want to thank Law Enforcement and the National Guard. I will see you on Tuesday!"
"Just had a wonderful conversation with my friend, Prime Minister @AbeShinzo of Japan, who will be leaving office soon. Shinzo will soon be recognized as the greatest Prime Minister in the history of Japan, whose relationship with the USA is the best it has ever been. Special man!"
"Kimberly Klacik is really working hard to help the people of Baltimore. She is running for Congress as a Republican, &amp; if she wins she will be an inspiration to all. She is strong on inner city rebuilding, healthcare, our Military &amp; Vets. She has my Complete &amp; Total Endorsement!"
"Just arrived in the Great State of Ohio. Real Polls have us leading by even more than 2016. With Biden being against Fracking (Energy &amp; Jobs) &amp; your Second Amendment, we should be in very good shape!"

"..The people of Portland, like all other cities &amp;  parts of our great Country, want Law &amp; Order. The Radical Left Democrat Mayors, like the dummy running Portland, or the guy right now in his basement unwilling to lead or even speak out against crime, will never be able to do it!"
".@Amazon, and others in that business, should be charged (by the U.S. Postal System) much more per package, and the Post Office would be immediately brought back to ‚Äúgood health‚Äù, now vibrant, with ALL jobs saved. No pass on to customers. Get it done!"
"Tell the Dems that we have more Cases because we do FAR more Testing than any other Country!"
"....Obamacare is a joke! Deductible is far too high and the overall cost is ridiculous. My Administration has gone out of its way to manage OC much better than previous, but it is still no good. I will ALWAYS PROTECT PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS,ALWAYS!!!"
"Now that the very expensive, unpopular and unfair Individual Mandate provision has been terminated by us, many States &amp; the U.S. are asking the Supreme Court that Obamacare itself be terminated so that it can be replaced with a FAR BETTER AND MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE....."
" 
"Joe Biden is coming out of the basement earlier than his hoped for ten days because his people told him he has no choice, his poll numbers are PLUNGING! Going to Pittsburgh, where I have helped industry to a record last year, &amp; then back to his  basement for an extended period..."
"THANK YOU! #MAGA2020 

"Rest In Peace Jay! 
"....His problem is interesting. He must always be weak on CRIME because of the Bernie Sanders Radical Left voter. If he loses them, like Crooked Hillary did, he is ‚Äútoast‚Äù, and many will vote for me because of TRADE (Bernie was good on trade). Joe MUST always be weak on crime!"
"When Joe Biden was VP...
" 
"For the 1/100th time, the reason we show so many Cases, compared to other countries that haven‚Äôt done nearly as well as we have, is that our TESTING is much bigger and better. We have tested 40,000,000 people. If we did 20,000,000 instead, Cases would be half, etc. NOT REPORTED!"
"When is Slow Joe Biden going to criticize the Anarchists, Thugs &amp; Agitators in ANTIFA? When is he going to suggest bringing up the National Guard in BADLY RUN &amp; Crime Infested Democrat Cities &amp; States? Remember, he can‚Äôt lose the Crazy Bernie Super Liberal vote!"
"PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!"
"People are tired of watching the highly political @NBA. Basketball ratings are WAY down, and they won‚Äôt be coming back. I hope football and baseball are watching and learning because the same thing will be happening to them. Stand tall for our Country and our Flag!!!"
"Corrupt Joe Biden said yesterday that we have over ‚Äú120 million‚Äù people dead of Coronavirus!"

"‚ÄúWe know what took place. We have already seen criminality. What is happening? Biggest political scandal of our time.‚Äù @MariaBartiromo You are 100% correct, Maria, it is a disgrace that nothing happens. Obama and Biden spied on my campaign, AND GOT CAUGHT...BUT NOTHING!"

"Good luck to Sean Compton, a winner at everything he does! 
"PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT!"

"We catch them all! 
"The Supreme Court sends case back to Lower Court, arguments to continue. This is all a political prosecution. I won the Mueller Witch Hunt, and others, and now I have to keep fighting in a politically corrupt New York. Not fair to this Presidency or Administration!"

"It never ends! Now they are trying to say that your favorite President, me, went to Walter Reed Medical Center, having suffered a series of mini-strokes. Never happened to THIS candidate - FAKE NEWS. Perhaps they are referring to another candidate from another Party!"
"Great! 
"Courts in the past have given ‚Äúbroad deference‚Äù. BUT NOT ME!"
"100% True! 
"Heading to Kenosha, Wisconsin, to thank Law Enforcement and the National Guard for a job well done. The Violence stopped six days ago, the moment the Guard entered the picture. Thank you!"

"Great! 

"Can‚Äôt let this happen! 
"Had a very productive conversation with Kevin Warren, Commissioner of the Big Ten Conference, about immediately starting up Big Ten football. Would be good (great!) for everyone - Players, Fans, Country. On the one yard line!"
"....Won all against the Federal Government and the Democrats send everything to politically corrupt New York, which is falling apart with everyone leaving, to give it a second, third and fourth try. Now the Supreme Court gives a  delay ruling that they would never have given..."
"....for another President. This is about PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT. We catch the other side SPYING on my campaign, the biggest political crime and scandal in U.S. history, and NOTHING HAPPENS. But despite this, I have done more than any President in history in first 3 1/2 years!"
"We are! 
"We have a totally corrupt previous Administration, including a President and Vice President who spied on my campaign, AND GOT CAIGHT...and nothing happens to them. This crime was taking place even before my election, everyone knows it, and yet all are frozen stiff with fear...."

"....No Republican Senate Judiciary response, NO ‚ÄúJUSTICE‚Äù, NO FBI, NO NOTHING. Major horror show REPORTS on Comey &amp; McCabe, guilty as hell, nothing happens. Catch Obama &amp; Biden cold, nothing. A 3 year, $45,000,000 Mueller HOAX, failed - investigated everything...."
"Nissan is rolling out it‚Äôs 2021 ROGUE from TENNESSEE. Great!"

"We have a totally corrupt previous Administration, including a President and Vice President who spied on my campaign, AND GOT CAUGHT...and nothing happens to them. This crime was taking place even before my election, everyone knows it, and yet all are frozen stiff with fear...."
"The Democrats are only interested in BAILING OUT their badly managed, high crime, Blue States. They are not interested in our workers or small businesses. Crazy Nancy will only do stimulus, which would be helpful, if we couple it with bailout money. Republican States are great!!!"

"...Nobody‚Äôs been tougher on Russia than the Trump Administration. With Corrupt Joe Biden &amp; Obama, Russia had a field day, taking over important parts of Ukraine - Where‚Äôs Hunter? Probably just another phony Times hit job, just like their failed Russia Hoax. Who is their ‚Äúsource‚Äù?"
"Nobody briefed or told me, @VP Pence, or Chief of Staff @MarkMeadows about the so-called attacks on our troops in Afghanistan by Russians, as reported through an ‚Äúanonymous source‚Äù by the Fake News @nytimes. Everybody is denying it &amp; there have not been many attacks on us....."

"I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:30 A.M. Enjoy!"
"Biden will destroy the United States Supreme Court. Don‚Äôt let this happen!"
"If Sleepy Joe Biden is actually elected President, the 4 Justices (plus1) that helped make such a ridiculous win possible would be relegated to sitting on not only a heavily PACKED COURT, but probably a REVOLVING COURT as well. At least the many new Justices will be Radical Left!"

"For those that thought I wasn‚Äôt into the Environment, this is the biggest bill ever passed, by far. I wonder if this will silence the Fake News? Probably not! 
"NASA was Closed &amp; Dead until I got it going again. Now it is the most vibrant place of its kind on the Planet...And we have Space Force to go along with it. We have accomplished more than any Administration in first 3 1/2 years. Sorry, but it all doesn‚Äôt happen with Sleepy Joe! 
"More Testing equals more Cases. We have best testing. Deaths WAY DOWN. Hospitals have great additional capacity! Doing much better than Europe. Therapeutics working!"

"SECOND AMENDMENT!"
"I would NEVER have taken the endorsement of the man who, through gross incompetence, poisoned the people of Flint, Michigan. Former RINO Governor Rick Snyder should be ashamed of himself and his service. I was asked to help fix it. Biden took his endorsement. VOTE TRUMP!!!"
"This decision is CRAZY and so bad for our Country. Can you imagine what will happen during that nine day period. The Election should END on November 3rd.

"Joe Biden is a corrupt politician‚Äîthe Biden family is looking more &amp; more like a crime family. They took millions of $$ from the Chinese Communists, while Vice President Biden shipped Michigan jobs to China. If Biden wins, China Wins. When we win, Michigan wins, and AMERICA wins!

"President Obama used to say that ‚Äúif you wanted to see something really screwed up, give it to Joe Biden to do.‚Äù In fact, he tried to keep Joe from running, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have to do this Joe‚Äù, and then wouldn‚Äôt endorse him until long after the Primaries ended. ‚ÄúJoe is lost!‚Äù."

"Your far-left Dem Attorney General, and your Dem Governor tried to shut down our rally, silence the people of Minnesota, and take away your freedom of assembly. They thought we would cancel ‚Äì but I said NO WAY, I will NEVER abandon the people of Minnesota! 

"...Biden‚Äôs deadly migration policies will overwhelm taxpayers and open the floodgates to terrorists, jihadists, and violent extremists. Under my Administration, the safety of our families will always come FIRST!"

"Joe Biden is a corrupt politician who has done nothing but betray you for 47 long years - selling out to lobbyists, China, big pharma &amp; foreign countries. He will stab you in the back. He only cares about political power &amp; he will use that power to hurt you &amp; enrich his cronies!

"Hogan Gidley will be leaving the White House on July 1 and heading over to my campaign to be the National Press Secretary.  He is a strong, loyal and trusted member of the team that I know will do an outstanding job! We must WIN this election! Follow him at @JHoganGidley."
"LAW &amp; ORDER!!!"
"Law and Order. If @NYCMayor can‚Äôt do it, we will! 
"Will be landing in Minnesota shortly where early VOTING has begun, and Absentee Ballots (information below) are now being sent out. Wish I could vote there, but I‚Äôll have to rely on you! #Vote #TrumpPence2020 

"We broke them up last night, fast. Numerous are, and will be, in prison! 
"Cases up only because of our big number testing. Mortality rate way down!!! 
"Joe Biden says this is a race between Scranton and Park Avenue. This is a race between Scranton and China. Joe Biden betrayed Scranton, and America, to China and foreign countries. I will always put America First!"
"This would be the beginning of the end. He has no clue, but he wouldn‚Äôt be calling the shots!!! 
"...Biden is a corrupt globalist sellout who never missed a chance to stab American workers in the back. If Biden wins, China wins ‚Äì it‚Äôs just that simple!"

"...And if the Federal Government wasn‚Äôt getting ready to go in, and we were all set, it would still be a squatter‚Äôs (anarchist‚Äôs) mess! 
"Great going Jim. Proud of you! 
"Today, it was my great honor to nominate one of our nation‚Äôs most brilliant and gifted legal minds to the Supreme Court. She is a woman of unparalleled achievement, towering intellect, sterling credentials, and unyielding loyalty to the Constitution: Judge Amy Coney Barrett... 
"...Obama killed the pharmaceutical manufacturing business in Puerto Rico. We are bringing it back from China and other faraway lands."

"I will be strongly demanding a Drug Test of Sleepy Joe Biden prior to, or after, the Debate on Tuesday night. Naturally, I will agree to take one also. His Debate performances have been record setting UNEVEN, to put it mildly. Only drugs could have caused this discrepancy???"

"Hanoi Dick, who lied for years by saying he was a war hero in Vietnam, and was never even there (Impeach him!), should not be entitled to a vote on anything of importance!

"Great!  Appeals Court Upholds Justice Departments Request To Drop Criminal Case Against General Michael Flynn!"

"Some states use ‚Äúdrop boxes‚Äù for the collection of Universal Mail-In Ballots. So who is going to ‚Äúcollect‚Äù the Ballots, and what might be done to them prior to tabulation? A Rigged Election? So bad for our Country. Only Absentee Ballots acceptable!"

"I will be doing a major Fake @NBCNews Town Hall Forum, live tonight from Miami, at 8:00 P.M. They asked me to do it in place of the Rigged Steve Scully (he is now suspended from @cspan for lying) Debate. I wonder if they‚Äôll treat me as well as Sleepy Joe? They should!"
"The U.S. Post Office (System) has been failing for many decades. We simply want to MAKE THE POST OFFICE GREAT AGAIN, while at the same time saving billions of dollars a year for American Taxpayers. Dems don‚Äôt have a clue! @USPostOffice911"
"It was great to be back in North Carolina with thousands of loyal, hardworking American Patriots! This election is a simple choice: If Biden Wins, China Wins. When WE Win, YOU WIN, North Carolina WINS, and America WINS! 
"I was right again! Steve Scully just admitted he was lying about his Twitter being hacked. The Debate was Rigged! He was suspended from @cspan indefinitely. The Trump Campaign was not treated fairly by the ‚ÄúCommission‚Äù. Did I show good instincts in being the first to know?"
"Winning Big. Next year, if I‚Äôm re-elected, will be our best  year ever! Sleepy Joe wants to quadruple your taxes and go to socialized healthcare. Depression! 
"Wow, nobody realized how far Mini Mike Bloomberg went in bribing ex-prisoners to go out and vote for Sleepy Joe. He is desperate to get back into the good graces of the people who not only badly beat him, but made him look like a total fool. Now he‚Äôs committed a serious crime!"
"What‚Äôs with @CNN POLLS increasing me by 10 points in a short period of time. Maybe they want to take over from @FoxNews!"
"Getting ready to land in Minneapolis. Our great National Guard saved the city from further destruction. Should have been called up sooner by local government!"
"Wow. @CNN got caught cold manipulating the words and meaning of my 4th of July Speech. They were brazen, desperate. Watch what happens!"
"Is James Comey and his band of Dirty Cops going to apologize to General Michael Flynn (and many others) for what they have done to ruin his life? What about Robert Mueller and his Angry Democrat Cronies - Are they going to say, SO SORRY? And what about Obama &amp; Biden?"
"Portland is a mess, and it has been for many years. If this joke of a mayor doesn‚Äôt clean it up, we will go in and do it for them!"
"VIRGINIA, and everywhere else for that matter, I am the only thing standing between you and your 2nd Amendment. If I am re-elected, it is 100% SAFE. If not, it is GONE!"
"Just approved (and fast) the FULL Emergency Declaration for the Great State of Iowa. They got hit hard by record setting winds. Thank you to @SenJoniErnst, @ChuckGrassley, and Governor Kim Reynolds."
"LAW &amp; ORDER!"
"...And 96% in the Republican Party. Save your 2nd Amendment! 
"Obamacare will be replaced with a MUCH better, and FAR cheaper, alternative if it is terminated in the Supreme Court. Would be a big WIN for the USA!"

".@FoxNews gladly puts up the phony suppression polls as soon as they come out. We are leading in the REAL polls because people are sick &amp; tired of watching the Democrat run cities, in all cases, falling apart. Also, now 96% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Another 2016!"

".@FoxNews weekend afternoons is the worst! Getting into @CNN and MSDNC territory. Watch @OANN &amp; @newsmax instead. Much better!"

"Chicago and New York City crime numbers are way up. 67 people shot in Chicago, 13 killed. Shootings up significantly in NYC where people are demanding that @NYGovCuomo &amp; @NYCMayor act now. Federal Government ready, willing and able to help, if asked!"
"Why is Congress scheduled to meet (on Post Office) next Monday, during the Republican Convention, rather than now, while the Dems are having their Convention. They are always playing games. GET TOUGH REPUBLICANS!!!"
"Just watched what Biden had to say. To me, he‚Äôs blaming the Police far more than he‚Äôs blaming the Rioters, Anarchists, Agitators, and Looters, which he could never blame or he would lose the Radical Left Bernie supports!"
"No thanks! 
"Buy Lou‚Äôs GREAT New Book! 

"SAVE THE POST OFFICE!"
"....the good and the bad. It is important for us to understand and remember, even in turbulent and difficult times, and learn from them. Knowledge comes from the most unusual of places!"
"Very sad to see States allowing roving gangs of wise guys, anarchists &amp; looters, many of them having no idea what they are doing, indiscriminately ripping down our statues and monuments to the past. Some are great works of art, but all represent our History &amp; Heritage, both...."
"Democrats want to Defund &amp; Abolish Police. This despite poor crime numbers in cities that they run. CRAZY!"
"It was my great honor to free up 5000 square miles of ocean off the coast of Maine. Enjoy!"
"FAKE NEWS!"
"Pelosi is holding up STIMULUS, not the Republicans!"

"This is totally illegal. Hope that the U.S. Attorney in Minnesota has this, and other of her many misdeeds, under serious review??? If not, why not??? We will win Minnesota because of her, and law enforcement. Saved Minneapolis &amp; Iron O Range! 
"Statue of Frederick Douglass Torn Down in Rochester  via @BreitbartNews. This shows that these anarchists have no bounds!"

"Has @BubbaWallace apologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers &amp; officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, &amp; were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX? That &amp; Flag decision has caused lowest ratings EVER!"

"Thank you! 
"The Ballots being returned to States cannot be accurately counted. Many things are already going very wrong!"
".....Financial Statements, from  the time I announced I was going to run for President,  showing all properties, assets and debts. It is a very IMPRESSIVE Statement, and also shows that I am the only President on record to give up my yearly $400,000 plus Presidential Salary!"

".....Also, if you look at the extraordinary assets owned by me, which the Fake News hasn‚Äôt, I am extremely under leveraged - I have very little debt compared to the value of assets. Much of this information is already on file, but I have long said that I may release...."

"A @FoxNews commentator just ripped me with lies, with nobody defending. They talked about the ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù protesters (they set the Church on fire the day before. They were anything but friendly), and how I stood and held the Bible upside down - it wasn‚Äôt upside down. @edhenry"
"Cuomo, just like his brother Fredo, has not got a very good memory!

"The Fake News Media, just like Election time 2016, is bringing up my Taxes &amp; all sorts of other nonsense with illegally obtained information &amp; only bad intent. I paid many millions of dollars in taxes but was entitled, like everyone else, to depreciation &amp; tax credits....."
"If Big Tech persists, in coordination with the mainstream media, we must immediately strip them of their Section 230 protections. When government granted these protections, they created a monster!

"‚ÄúThis is no longer about peaceful protesting, this is about angry, violent, criminal mobs taking over certain (Democrat run) cities. It is a lack of political leadership in that city.‚Äù Chad Wolf @DHSgov @foxandfriends @NYGovCuomo @NYCMayor"

"Joe Biden just announced that he will not agree to a Drug Test. Gee, I wonder why?"

"NASDAQ HITS ALL TIME HIGH!"

"The number of ChinaVirus cases goes up, because of GREAT TESTING, while the number of deaths (mortality rate), goes way down. The Fake News doesn‚Äôt like telling you that!"

"SCHOOLS MUST OPEN IN THE FALL!!!"
"The Democrats would not have BANNED travel from heavily infected China, especially so early, therefore, far more people would have died. Corrupt Joe Biden now admits this!!!"
"Told that @NYCMayor Bill de Blasio wants to paint the fabled &amp; beautiful Fifth Avenue, right in front of Trump Tower/Tiffany, with a big yellow Black Lives Matter sign. ‚ÄúPigs in a Blanket, Fry ‚ÄòEm Like Bacon‚Äù, referring to killing Police, is their chant. NYC Police are furious!"

"LAW &amp; ORDER!"
"People want respect for our Anthem and our Flag. Ratings will only get worse! Didn‚Äôt we go through this once before?

"Will be interviewed by @marklevinshow on @FoxNews tonight at 8:00 P.M. Enjoy!"
"A weak and pathetic Democrat Mayor!!! 
"....He tried mixing with the Agitators and Anarchists and they mocked him. He would like to blame me and the Federal Government for going in, but he hasn‚Äôt seen anything yet. We have only been there with a small group to defend our U.S. Courthouse, because he couldn‚Äôt do it...."

"Thank you #Truckers4Trump!

"Somebody please explain to @MichelleObama that Donald J. Trump would not be here, in the beautiful White House, if it weren‚Äôt for the job done by your husband, Barack Obama. Biden was merely an afterthought, a good reason for that very late &amp;  unenthusiastic endorsement....."

"John Bolton is, with the exception of Hillary, by far the worst offender of them all! 
"This guy is given the answer to questions, which he reads from his teleprompter. Is Donna  involved in this scam? Could you imagine if I got caught doing this. The media will never report this scam (FAKE) candidate. Sad! 
"The incompetent Mayor of Washington, D.C., @MayorBowser, who‚Äôs budget is totally out of control and is constantly coming back to us for ‚Äúhandouts‚Äù, is now fighting with the National Guard, who saved her from great embarrassment..."

"...We should be standing up straight and tall, ideally with a salute, or a hand on heart. There are other things you can protest, but not our Great American Flag - NO KNEELING!"
"I really appreciate all of the fans and supporters outside of the hospital. The fact is, they really love our Country and are seeing how we are MAKING IT GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE!"


"I am a big fan of Drew Brees. I think he‚Äôs truly one of the greatest quarterbacks, but he should not have taken back his original stance on honoring our magnificent American Flag. OLD GLORY is to be revered, cherished, and flown high..."
".@MayorBowser is grossly incompetent, and in no way qualified to be running an important city like Washington, D.C. If the great men and women of the National Guard didn‚Äôt step forward, she would have looked no better than her counterpart Mayor in Minneapolis!"
"I want to defend &amp; preserve our nation‚Äôs historic values. Our opponents stand with rioters ‚Äì I stand with the heroes of Law Enforcement. Biden says Antifa is just an idea. Ideas don‚Äôt assault cops &amp; burn down buildings. Antifa is a domestic terrorist org. 
"Just landed in Minnesota. Hasn‚Äôt been won by a Republican since 1972, and we saved Minneapolis. Also opened the massive and beautiful Iron Range, which Obama and Sleepy Joe closed.  Thousands of jobs started back. They will close again. How can we lose?"
"So weird to watch @FoxNews interviewing only failed Dems, like Represenative Tim Ryan of Ohio, who got zero percent in his recent presidential run, and following Sleepy Joe‚Äôs train to wherever. What a difference from the past - But we will win anyway!!!"
"Leaving Minneapolis for a quick stop in Duluth to celebrate the opening of the Obama CLOSED Iron Range. My great honor!!!"
"The Real Polls are starting to look GREAT! We will be having an even bigger victory than that of 2016. The Radical Left Anarchists, Agitators, Looters, and just plain Lunatics, will not be happy, but they will behave!"
"Great! 
"Try getting a new Anchor and a smarter Democrat candidate! 
"....And because of weak and pathetic Democrat leadership, this thuggery is happening in other Democrat run cities and states. Must shut them down fast. Biden and his most Liberal in Senate running mate, Kamala, won‚Äôt even talk about it. They won‚Äôt utter the words, LAW &amp; ORDER!"
"BLM Protesters horribly harass elderly Pittsburgh diners, scaring them with loud taunts while taking their food right off their plate. These Anarchists, not protesters, are Biden voters, but he has no control and nothing to say. Disgraceful. Never seen anything like it. Thugs!"
"Last night I did what the corrupt media has refused to do: I held Joe Biden Accountable for his 47 years of lies, 47 years of betrayals, and 47 years of failure. The whole nation saw the truth ‚Äî Joe Biden is too weak to lead this Country! 
"So when will something significant happen to James Comey? Got caught cold. He is either very dumb, or one of the worst liars in political history. TOO LONG. EMBARRASSING!"

"Democrat John Hickenlooper Held in Contempt After Failing to Comply with Subpoena over Ethics Complaint  Got caught big time with his hand in the cookie jar. Should be the end of his Colorado Senate bid. Makes no difference, we already have a GREAT Senator!"

"Virginia Voters! Your Governor wants to obliterate your Second Amendment. I have stopped him. I am the only thing between you and your Second Amendment. Working hard in Virginia. It‚Äôs IN PLAY. Better Vote for your favorite President, or wave goodbye to low taxes and gun rights!"

"We will always defend. Great job Jay! 
"PRO LIFE! VOTE!"
"The Democrats have stated strongly that they won‚Äôt approve a Payroll Tax Cut (too bad!). It would be great for workers. The Republicans, therefore, didn‚Äôt want to ask for it. Dems, as usual, are hurting the working men and women of our Country!"
"BETTER &amp; CHEAPER HEALTHCARE. VOTE!"
"Obama, who wouldn‚Äôt even endorse Biden until everyone else was out of the primaries (and even then waited a long time!), is now making a commercial of support. Remember, I wouldn‚Äôt even be here if it weren‚Äôt for them. I wouldn‚Äôt be President. They did a terrible job!"

"Great! Biden is finally being forced out of his basement. Now you‚Äôll be able to see what is going on ‚Äúup there‚Äù. He may do some ‚Äúlimited‚Äù campaigning. Basement Biden is no longer playing well in the Polls!"

"Crazy! 

"‚ÄúThis is a flat out lie. They (the media) are making things up‚Äù @CharlesHurt  @IngrahamAngle The Lamestream Media is out of control. It would be impossible to fully explain how dishonest they are!"
"His all time favorite ad. Disgraceful! 
"As VP, Biden wiped out the Iron Range ‚Äì seven plants were idled and more than 2K workers were laid off. After I put Tariffs on foreign steel, the Iron Range came roaring back to life! If Joe gets in, the Radical Left will shut down the Iron Range FOREVER!

"Wow. Joe Biden just took a more Liberal position on Roe v. Wade than Elizabeth Warren at her highest. He also wants to PACK our great United States Supreme Court. This is what the Dems will do. Remember as they try changing positions before elections end. GET OUT AND VOTE!"
"Riot gear or military control is not necessary because ANTIFA &amp; other Wacko groups of Anarchists aren‚Äôt present to cause trouble. Incredible people. Thank you Maine! 
"Biden and Democrats just clarified the fact that they are fully in favor of (very) LATE TERM ABORTION, right up until the time of birth, and beyond - which would be execution. Biden even endorsed the Governor of Virginia, who stated this clearly for all to hear. GET OUT &amp; VOTE!!!"
"The Democrats will open up their states on November 4th, the day after the Election. These shutdowns are ridiculous, and only being done to hurt the economy prior to the most important election, perhaps, in our history! #MAGA"

"My Campaign spent a lot of money up front in order to compensate for the false reporting and Fake News concerning our handling of the China Virus. Now they see the GREAT job we have done, and we have 3 times more than we had 4 years ago - &amp; are up in polls. Lots of $‚Äôs &amp; ENERGY!"
"Flu season is coming up! Many people every year, sometimes over 100,000, and despite the Vaccine, die from the Flu. Are we going to close down our Country? No, we have learned to live with it, just like we are learning to live with Covid, in most populations far less lethal!!!"
"Wow. Win in 2020!!!

"Congratulations Jim. It was a great and beautiful event. Well deserved! 
"Because of the China Virus, my Campaign, which has raised a lot of money, was forced to spend in order to counter the Fake News reporting about the way we handled it (China Ban, etc.). We did, and are doing, a GREAT job, and have a lot of money left over, much more than 2016...."

"THANK YOU! 
"They are not ‚Äúpeaceful protesters‚Äù, as Sleepy Joe and the Democrats call them, they are THUGS - And it is all taking place in Democrat run cities. Call me and request Federal HELP. We will solve your problems in a matter of minutes - And thanks to the U.S. Marshalls in Portland!"

"On my way to the Great State of Florida, see you soon! 


"...to virtual pennies. Epi-pens went from their incredibly high, jacked up prices, to lower than their original give away bargains. Biggest price reductions in history, by far! Nothing like this has ever for our citizens, especially our Seniors. REMEMBER YOUR FAVORITE PRESIDENT!"
"Yesterday I signed four measures that will massively reduce the prices of prescription drugs, in many cases by more than 50%. Nothing like this has ever been done before because Big Pharma, with its vast power, would not let it happen. Expensive Insulin went from big dollars....."
"The Fake News Media refuses to discuss how good the Economy and Stock Market, including JOBS under the Trump Administration, are doing. We will soon be in RECORD TERRITORY. All they want to discuss is COVID 19, where they won‚Äôt say it, but we beat the Dems all day long, also!!!"
"Wow! 96% Approval Rating in the Republican Party (and I believe this was before the ‚ÄúGREAT‚Äù Jobs Numbers yesterday). Thank you!"

"Wow! 
"Democrats admit that President Trump‚Äôs message is ‚Äúworking‚Äù on violence coming to the Suburbs in a Looney Biden Administration. Plus, Biden just doubled down on forcing Federal control of local zoning. This means low income housing and projects. So much for the American Dream!"
"LAW &amp; ORDER!"
"REPEAL SECTION 230!!!"
"The Democrats in the House are trying to undo my big win Travel Ban Bill, which successfully keeps very bad and dangerous people out of our great Country. Passed along party lines. Hopefully, will be DEAD in the Senate! The Dems have gone Stone Cold Left - Venezuela on steroids!"

"Did anyone get to see that absolute ‚ÄúJoke‚Äù of a Town Hall interview that Joe Biden did with Concast @NBCNews , hosted by Lester Holt? What a disgrace to our Country that FREE public airwaves can be used that way. All SOFTBALLS. A big FIX. Time should be paid by the corrupt DNC!"
"Sleepy Joe Biden has pledged to ABOLISH Suburban Communites as they currently exist by reinstating Obama‚Äôs radical AFFH Regulation. There goes Suburbia!"

"How does Biden lead in Pennsylvania Polls when he is against Fracking (JOBS!), 2nd Amendment and Religion? Fake Polls. I will win Pennsylvania!"
"Colin Powell, a real stiff who was very responsible for getting us into the disastrous Middle East Wars, just announced he will be voting for another stiff, Sleepy Joe Biden. Didn‚Äôt Powell say that Iraq had ‚Äúweapons of mass destruction?‚Äù They didn‚Äôt, but off we went to WAR!"
"True! 
"@BrandonStraka Many Democrats are leaving the party over calls to Defund the Police. @foxandfriends @PeteHegseth  Great going Brandon. You really get it!!!"
"Crazy Nancy Pelosi and the Radical Left Democrats were just playing ‚Äúgames‚Äù with the desperately needed Workers Stimulus Payments.They just wanted to take care of Democrat failed, high crime, Cities and States. They were never in it to help the workers, and they never will be!"
"Fantastic job on @foxandfriends by new Republican Superstar @SeanParnellUSA, running for Congress (with my complete &amp; total Endorsement) against a Crazy Nancy Pelosi Puppet (who has done nothing!), &amp; a slightly older Republican Superstar, @GovMikeHuckabee. Thank you to both!"

"One of the most important issues is LAW &amp; ORDER. Biden stands with the rioters &amp; looters - I stand with the HEROES of law enforcement. If Biden wins, the rioters in the streets will be running your federal government. No city, no family, and no community will be safe. VOTE #MAGA! 
"The Election should end on November 3rd., not weeks later!"
"This election is a choice between a Trump Super Boom or a Biden Depression, and it‚Äôs between a safe vaccine or a devastating Biden lockdown!  
"I‚Äôve done more in 47 months than Joe Biden has done in 47 years! A vote for Republicans is a vote for the American Dream, and the party of Abraham Lincoln! #MAGA 
"Joe Biden will lock down our entire Country. Biden will make you a prisoner in your own home, and a prisoner in your own Country. Biden‚Äôs plan will kill the American Dream‚ÄîGet your friends, get your family, get your neighbors and GET OUT AND VOTE! #MAGA 
"THANK YOU MINNESOTA!

"President Obama used to say that ‚Äúif you wanted to see something really screwed up, give it to Joe Biden to do.‚Äù In fact, he tried to keep Joe from running, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have to do this Joe‚Äù, and then wouldn‚Äôt endorse him until long after the Primaries ended. ‚ÄúJoe is lost!‚Äù."

"Your far-left Dem Attorney General, and your Dem Governor tried to shut down our rally, silence the people of Minnesota, and take away your freedom of assembly. They thought we would cancel ‚Äì but I said NO WAY, I will NEVER abandon the people of Minnesota! 

"...Biden‚Äôs deadly migration policies will overwhelm taxpayers and open the floodgates to terrorists, jihadists, and violent extremists. Under my Administration, the safety of our families will always come FIRST!"
"Biden has pledged a staggering 700% increase in refugees from the most dangerous and violent terrorist hot spots on earth. He has also vowed to terminate our national security travel bans, allowing for unlimited migration from war zones, and terrorist havens..."
"Joe Biden is a corrupt politician who has done nothing but betray you for 47 long years - selling out to lobbyists, China, big pharma &amp; foreign countries. He will stab you in the back. He only cares about political power &amp; he will use that power to hurt you &amp; enrich his cronies! 
"There is only one way to defend your dignity. There is only one way to defend your family and your Country. There is only one way to preserve, protect and defend the American Way of Life: you must show up and vote on November 3rd!  


"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
"‚ÄúA Biden win would mean the end of Fracking in Pennsylvania, Texas, and everywhere else. Millions of jobs would be lost, and Energy prices would soar.‚Äù @OANN  And we would no longer be Energy Independent!!!"
"Suburban Women are trending strongly to our campaign because they want SAFETY, SECURITY, and love the fact that I terminated the REGULATION that would destroy their neighborhood and with it, the American Dream. Biden would bring the REGULATION back in a MUCH stronger form!!!"
"Joe Biden spent the last 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders, and sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars. He is a diehard globalist who cares nothing for working people. He repeatedly tried to cut Medicare &amp; Social Security. Biden was..."
"‚ÄúPresident Obama meant a lot to Black people, but he didn‚Äôt do a thing for Black people‚Äù. Vernon Jones, Georgia State Represenative, Trump supporter. @ffweekend"
"I paid many millions of dollars in Taxes to the Federal Government, most of which was even paid early, or PREPAID. MANY $MILLIONS. The Failing @nytimes never likes reporting that!"
"Joe Biden will PACK THE COURT. Also, he never gave the answer who his Radical Left Justices will be!"
"Biden and the Radical Left are asking for the largest tax hike in the history of the U.S. Remember that when you VOTE!"
"Big win for our very elite U.S. Special Forces today. Details to follow!"

"Thank you Newtown, Pennsylvania! #MAGA 

"I ran for office 4 years ago because I could not sit by &amp; watch any longer as a small group of Washington Insiders continued to get rich bleeding America Dry. No one embodies this betrayal &amp; treachery more than Joe Biden. Joe profited from the misery he unleashed on PA workers! 
"Our ECONOMY is now surging back faster, better, bigger and stronger than any nation on earth. We just had the best quarter of ECONOMIC GROWTH EVER recorded - a 33.1% increase, and next year will be the GREATEST ECONOMIC YEAR in the history of our Country!  
"Biden‚Äôs plan to Abolish American Energy is an economic DEATH SENTENCE for Pennsylvania. A vote for Biden is a vote to BAN FRACKING &amp; send PA into a nightmare of poverty &amp; depression. Gas prices would explode &amp; family incomes would plummet‚ÄîI will always defend &amp; promote PA energy! 
"Biden &amp; Obama owe a massive apology to the People of Flint. The water was poisoned on their watch. Not only did they fail them, Biden proudly accepted the endorsement of disastrous Gov Rick Snyder! Unlike Biden, I will always stand with the People of the Great State of MICHIGAN!"
"Thank you Reading, Pennsylvania!

"3 days from now, we are going to win Pennsylvania! With your support, we will continue to bring back your jobs, and cut your taxes &amp; regulations. Biden would wipe out your factories, ship your jobs to China, raise your taxes, &amp; eliminate private healthcare!




"We invested $2.5 TRILLION in the Military and we saved the Philly Shipyard. We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability. Al-Baghdadi and Soleimani are DEAD. I withdrew from the disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal‚Äîand instead of endless war, we are forging PEACE in the Middle East! 
"Over the next four years, we will stop the radical indoctrination of our students, and restore PATRIOTIC EDUCATION to our schools. We will teach our children to love our Country, honor our history, and always respect our great American Flag.

"Sleepy Joe Hiden‚Äô was acknowledged by his own people to have done a terrible job on a much easier situation, H1N1 Swine Flu. The OBiden Administration failed badly on this, &amp; now he sits back in his basement and criticizes every move we make on the China Virus. DOING GREAT JOB!

"Biden and the Democrats have greatly disrespected the Great State of Wisconsin by not even paying a small visit to Milwaukee, the designated site of the DNC. The State &amp; City worked very hard to make sure things would be good. Not nice. Vote Trump Wisconsin!"

"Hunter Biden‚Äôs laptop is a disaster for the entire Biden family, but especially for his father, Joe. It is now a proven fact, and cannot be denied, that all of that info is the REAL DEAL. That makes it impossible for ‚Äú50%, or 10%‚Äù Joe, to ever assume the office of the President!"
"Many doctors and studies disagree with this!

"....that they are trying to pull off in violation of everything that our Country stands for. Vote NO to the Pelosi/ Schumer money wasting HOAX which is taking place now. Then fight the $51 million unasked for Ballots. Only ABSENTEE BALLOTS are acceptable!"

"Joe Biden and the Democrat Socialists will kill your jobs, dismantle your police departments, dissolve your borders, release criminal aliens, raise your taxes, confiscate your guns, end fracking, destroy your suburbs, and drive God from the public square. 
"The first thing Washington Democrats will do if Biden is elected is pack the Supreme Court with radical left judges who will eliminate your 2nd Amendment.

"The Radical Biden-Harris Agenda is projected to slash the typical American‚Äôs income by $6,500 per year. They will raise TAXES by $4 TRILLION DOLLARS ‚Äì triggering a mass exodus of jobs out of America and into foreign countries. 

"THANK YOU NORTH CAROLINA!

"ALERT: So now we find out that the entire Mueller ‚Äúhit squad‚Äù illegally wiped their phones clean just prior to the investigation of them, all using the same really dumb reason for this ‚Äúaccident‚Äù, just like Crooked Hillary smashing her phones with a hammer, &amp; DELETING HER EMAILS!"

"Sleepy Joe Biden had a particularly bad day today. He couldn‚Äôt remember the name of Mitt Romney, said again he was running for the U.S. Senate, and forgot what State he was in. If I did any of this, it would be disqualifying. With him, he‚Äôs just Sleepy Joe!"

"Great statement to Congress by @Jim_Jordan concerning Defunding (not!) our great Police. This Radical Left agenda is not going to happen. Sleepy Joe Biden will be (already is) pulled all the way Left. Many, like Minneapolis, want to close their Police Departments. Crazy!"

"Democrats and Biden didn‚Äôt even mention the Anarchists, Agitators, Looters and so called ‚ÄúPeaceful Protesters‚Äù at their Convention. They will allow rampant crime, just as they do in Portland. If they ask us, as they must do, we will end crime in their Democrat run cities, FAST!"

"Wacko John Bolton‚Äôs ‚Äúexceedingly tedious‚Äù(New York Times) book is made up of lies &amp; fake stories. Said all good about me, in print, until the day I fired him. A disgruntled boring fool who only wanted to go to war. Never had a clue, was ostracized &amp; happily dumped. What a dope!"

"Can‚Äôt believe how badly @CNN has done in the newly released TV ratings. They are so far below @FoxNews (thank you President Trump!) that you can barely find them. Fredo should be given a big pay cut! MSDNC also did poorly. As I have long said, Fake News does not pay!!!"
"Sean Parnell is an American Hero. Connor Lamm has proven to be an American fraud, and a puppet for Crazy Nancy Pelosi. He said he would NOT vote for her for Speaker, and did. Will kill 2A. Voted to impeach (on nothing).  A TOTAL &amp; COMPLETE Sean Parnell Endorsement!

"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a terrible situation, and I blame the leaders of those cities. The President of the United States has fought through a lot of different things since he‚Äôs been in office, and to be honest with you, he‚Äôs done one hell of a job.‚Äù @HerschelWalker @seanhannity @FoxNews"
"China is drooling. They can‚Äôt believe this!

"The Russia Bounty story is just another made up by Fake News tale that is told only to damage me and the Republican Party. The secret source probably does not even exist, just like the story itself. If the discredited @nytimes has a source, reveal it. Just another HOAX!"

"Great job being done by Dr. Nicole Saphier on @FoxNews!"
"THANK YOU NORTH CAROLINA!

"When Wacko John Bolton went on Deface the Nation and so stupidly said that he looked at the ‚ÄúLibyan Model‚Äù for North Korea, all hell broke out. Kim Jong Un, who we were getting along with very well, went ‚Äúballistic‚Äù, just like his missiles - and rightfully so...."

"No, I want Big Ten, and all other football, back - NOW. The Dems don‚Äôt want football back, for political reasons, but are trying to blame me and the Republicans. Another LIE, but this is what we are up against! They should also open up all of their Shutdown States."

"Vaccines are moving along fast and safely!"
"Joe Biden‚Äôs handling of the H1N1 Swine Flu was a complete and total disaster. Even polls on the matter were terrible!"
"....living in the state, no matter who they are or how they got there, will get one. That will be followed up with professionals telling all of these people, many of whom have never even thought of voting before, how, and for whom, to vote. This will be a Rigged Election. No way!"
"The W.H.O. really blew it. For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric. We will be giving that a good look. Fortunately I rejected their advice on keeping our borders open to China early on. Why did they give us such a faulty recommendation?"
"There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged &amp; even illegally printed out &amp; fraudulently signed. The Governor of California is sending Ballots to millions of people, anyone....."

"The opening of a Cold Case against Psycho Joe Scarborough was not a Donald Trump original thought, this has been going on for years, long before I joined the chorus. In 2016 when Joe &amp; his wacky future ex-wife, Mika, would endlessly interview me, I would always be thinking...."
"As President of the United States, I am asking for a legal solution on DACA, not a political one, consistent with the rule of law. The Supreme Court is not willing to give us one, so now we have to start this process all over again."

"....One person lost to this invisible virus is too much, it should have been stopped at its source, China, but I acted very quickly, and made the right decisions. Many of the current political complainers thought, at the time, that I was moving far to fast, like Crazy Nancy!"
"For all of the political hacks out there, if I hadn‚Äôt done my job well, &amp; early, we would have lost 1 1/2 to 2 Million People, as opposed to the 100,000 plus that looks like will be the number. That‚Äôs 15 to 20 times more than we will lose. I shut down entry from China very early!"

"New Mexico will only be GREAT with President Trump. We will win! 
"Wrong! We have more cases because we have tested far more than any other country, 60,000,000. If we tested less, there would be less cases. How did Italy, France &amp; Spain do? Now Europe sadly has flare ups. Most of our governors worked hard &amp; smart. We will come back STRONG!
